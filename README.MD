# Byondver

Small app that polls the byond latest version and posts the changelog to a or more discord webhook when a new version is available

Persistant files:
data/config.json | holds the webhook urls
data/data.json   | holds the last version posted

~~The app has to be updated each time theres a new major version, the update is simple, its just changing the link on the second request~~ NOT ANYMORE
